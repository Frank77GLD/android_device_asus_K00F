If you use my work than credit me!

This is for building the rom.
Its not working jet i think. Will need the modules added and other files in the right place.
This will build a cm9 rom cose thats what i have on my laptop here. Cm10.2, cm11 and cm12 will be done some time later.
Kernel file missing for now.
